# Code Suggestion Agent

## Overview
The Code Suggestion Agent is an intelligent real-time code suggestion tool built using a modern tech stack. It leverages Next.js for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and integrates advanced AI capabilities for generating code suggestions.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (for frontend)
- Python 3.8+ (for backend and AI)
- At least 8GB RAM (16GB recommended for optimal StarCoder performance)
- CUDA-compatible GPU (optional, but recommended for faster inference)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/code-suggestion-agent.git
   cd code-suggestion-agent
   ```


2. **Frontend Setup**
- Navigate to the frontend directory:
  ```
  cd frontend
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Start the Next.js application:
  ```
  npm run dev
  ```

3. **Backend Setup**
- Navigate to the backend directory:
  ```
  cd ../backend
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Start the FastAPI application:
  ```
  uvicorn app.main:app --reload
  ```

4. **AI Setup**
- Navigate to the AI directory:
  ```
  cd ../ai
  ```
- Install dependencies:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Configure environment variables (optional):
  - Copy the example env file: `cp .env.example .env`
  - Edit the `.env` file to customize settings

- Start the AI service:
  ```
  uvicorn api:app --reload --port 8001
  ```

## AI Component Configuration

The AI component uses environment variables for configuration, which can be set in a `.env` file:

### StarCoder settings
STARCODER_MODEL=bigcode/starcoder # Model name from Hugging Face DEVICE=cpu # Use "cuda" if you have a compatible GPU TEMPERATURE=0.7 # Higher values = more creative suggestions

### ChromaDB settings
CHROMA_PERSIST_DIR=chroma_db # Directory for persistent storage

### Embedding settings
EMBEDDING_MODEL=all-MiniLM-L6-v2 # Sentence transformer model for embeddings

## How the AI Component Works

The AI component has several key modules that work together:

1. **Code Suggestion Module**: Uses StarCoder (an open-source code generation model) through LangChain to provide intelligent code suggestions.

2. **Embeddings Module**: Converts code snippets into vector embeddings using Sentence Transformers.

3. **Vector Store Module**: Stores and retrieves similar code snippets using ChromaDB (an open-source vector database).

4. **Coordinator**: Orchestrates the workflow between these components.

5. **API Interface**: Provides both REST API and WebSocket endpoints for real-time code suggestions.

## API Endpoints

### REST Endpoints

- `POST /api/suggest`: Submit code for suggestions
  - Request body: `{code, file_path, language, surrounding_code, project_context, suggestion_type}`
  - Returns: `{suggestions: [{suggestion, confidence, source}]}`

- `POST /api/feedback`: Submit feedback on suggestions
  - Request body: `{code, file_path, language}` + `improved_code`
  - Returns: Success/failure message

### WebSocket Endpoint

- `ws://localhost:8001/ws/suggest`: Real-time code suggestions
  - Send: JSON with `{code, file_path, language, surrounding_code, project_context, suggestion_type}`
  - Receive: JSON with `{type: "suggestion", suggestions: [{suggestion, confidence, source}]}`

## Types of Code Suggestions

The AI component can provide different types of code suggestions:

- **improvement**: General code improvements for readability and maintainability
- **bug_fix**: Identification and correction of potential bugs
- **optimization**: Suggestions for performance improvements
- **refactoring**: Structural improvements without changing behavior
- **documentation**: Improvements to code comments and documentation

## Testing the Connection
- Ensure all three services (frontend, backend, and AI) are running.
- Test the connection by using the integrated code editor and checking for real-time suggestions.
